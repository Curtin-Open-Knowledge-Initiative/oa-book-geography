Code for More Readers in More Places
====================================

Code for the preprint More Readers in More Places and the report Diversifying Readership. See the preprint and report for more details. This code utilises [precipy](https://github.com/ananelson/precipy) to collect data from an online cloud-store, process and visualise it, and then generate the preprint from the template.

This repository is in the un-run state. That is it reflects the state of the directory before running main.py. To run successfully the code requires access credentials for the dataset so it will not run for most users. As the data is not fully shared this is not fully reproducible. See the [data repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4018842) for more details.
